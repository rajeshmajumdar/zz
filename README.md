## zz - Git alternative in Python

A git alternative but it's zz implemented in python. The whole goal behind this project is to understand the working og `git`.

### Progress
- [x] zz init

### Installation

It requires Python 3+, with mostly builtin modules.

```bash
$ chmod +x zz
$ ./zz init
```

### Issues

I only started this project to learn the working of `git`, if you find any issues or bugs in the code. Feel free to fork and fix it by yourself.
